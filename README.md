## Polygon Improvement Proposals (PIPs)

**Before you initiate a pull request**, please read the [PIP-1](https://github.com/maticnetwork/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/blob/main/PIPs/PIP-01.md) and [PIP-8](https://github.com/maticnetwork/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/blob/main/PIPs/PIP-08.md) process documents. Ideas should be thoroughly discussed on the [Polygon Community Forum](https://forum.polygon.technology/) first.
If your proposal is discussing a new contract standard, make sure you submit it under the [Polygon Request for Comment (PRC) folder](https://github.com/maticnetwork/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/tree/main/PIPs).
For more information on the processes and the PIP format, visit the [Guide on How to PIP.md](https://github.com/maticnetwork/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/blob/main/Guide%20on%20How%20to%20PIP.md)

This repository tracks ongoing improvements to the Polygon protocols. It contains:

- The [process document](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-1-pip-purpose-and-guidelines/11356) that governs how protocol changes are published.
- The successfully submitted PIPs.
- The [PRC folder](https://github.com/maticnetwork/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/tree/main/PIPs/PRC), which, similarly to the "Ethereum Request for Comment" (ERC), is dedicated to PIP proposals that discuss token standards.
- The Project Management of the PIPs process and the Polygon Protocol Governance Calls (read below).

### Mission

In a decentralized and self-governed system, a framework is necessary for the developer community to inform, propose, and gather technical feedback on new features.

By introducing a transparent and versioned repository, the community maintains a historical record of all feature proposals, including their revision history and implementation progress.

### Preferred Citation Format

Consider any document not published by the PIP repository as a working paper. Additionally, consider published PIPs with a status of "draft", "review", or "last call" to be incomplete drafts, and note that their specification is likely to be subject to change.

## Project Management

### Purpose

The Polygon Protocol Governance Call is a technical call intended to bring together various Polygon Labs' developers, such as those on the Governance, Validator Support, PoS (Proof of Stake), and Research teams, with the broader Polygon community. The goal is to provide updates on their projects, discuss various Polygon Improvement Proposals (PIPs) to enhance the protocols, and support each other as they build Web 3.0.

During these calls, participants can expect to:

Receive Project Updates: Developers from different teams within Polygon Labs will share the latest developments and progress on their respective projects. This ensures that everyone is informed about ongoing initiatives and future plans.

Discuss PIPs: Various Polygon Improvement Proposals are brought up for discussion. These proposals aim to improve the functionality, security, and efficiency of the Polygon protocols. Community members and developers alike can provide feedback, suggest modifications, and help shape the future of the Polygon network.

Community Support and Collaboration: The call provides a platform for developers and community members to support each other. By sharing knowledge, addressing challenges, and brainstorming solutions, the participants collectively contribute to the growth and success of the Polygon ecosystem.

The calls are transcribed and recorded and will be available immediately after the meetings conclude. This ensures transparency and allows those who could not attend to stay updated on the discussions and decisions made during the call.

By fostering open communication and collaboration, the Polygon Protocol Governance Call plays a crucial role in the development and advancement of the Polygon network, contributing to the broader vision of building Web 3.0.

### Agenda

The agenda for the meetings are hosted under the Project Management folder. Please send a pull request to the open agenda, mentioning the topic you want to discuss and linking any relevant materials (PIPs, prototypes, etc.)

Anyone is welcome to add an item to the agenda as long as it follows the following guidelines:

- The topic is technical in nature.
- The topic involves the Polygon protocols at a low level. This means that specific Dapps are generally not allowed as topics.
- The topic should not be philosophical. The Polygon Protocol Governance Calls are not meant to decide contentious philosophical issues that the community should decide. There are exceptions to this, but generally, these topics distract from more productive technical discussion.

### Who Can Attend

Core Protocol developers, Polygon Labs Researchers, PoS validators, and the dApp and ecosystem community members are invited to attend the meetings.
